// <Skill id>,<Cast>,<Delay (optional)>

// Cast:  0 - everything affects the skill's cast time
//        1 - skill's cast time is not affected by dex
//        2 - skill's cast time is not affected by statuses (Suffragium, etc)
//        4 - skill's cast time is not affected by item bonuses (equip, cards)
//
// Delay: 0 - everything affects the skill's delay
//        1 - skill's delay is not affected by dex
//        2 - skill's delay is not affected by Magic Strings / Bragi
//        4 - skill's delay is not affected by item bonuses (equip, cards)
//
// Note: Values are bit fields, add them up to combine their effects.
// Note: Delay setting '1' only makes sense when delay_dependon_dex is enabled.
// Example: 46,1,1 = Double Strafe's cast time and delay is not affected by dex.
