// Hocus-Pocus (Abracadabra) Castable Skills Database
//
// Structure of Database:
// SkillID,DummyName,ProbabilityPerLvl
//
// 01. SkillID                  Skill ID to be casted by hocus pocus.
// 02. DummyName                Name of the skill (informative, not used by server).
// 03. ProbabilityPerLvl        Not a rate! Chance at which the skill is selected compared
//                              with other entries probabilties
//
// NOTE:
// - The skill is picked at random from the entire database and then tested for rate. If it
//   does not succeed at that rate, another skill is picked and tested. This continues
//   until a skill succeeds. Abracadabra-specific skills have a different chance to occur
//   depending on skill level used. All other skills have an equal chance and appear from
//   level 1 onward.
// - To remove entry by importing, put "clear" (without quotes) in DummyName
